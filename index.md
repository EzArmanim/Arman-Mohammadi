**Hydrology and Hydroclimatology — available Oct 2025**

I’m an MSc candidate at Politecnico di Torino focusing on **trend detection** and **climatic attribution** of river flows. I build Python/GIS workflows for annual, seasonal, and monthly flow metrics (mean/low/high) and map spatial patterns relevant to water management, drought planning and flood risk.

- **Interests:** hydro-climate extremes, water-resources adaptation, remote sensing of ET & soil moisture, hydrological modelling, model calibration & uncertainty analysis, climate-model down-scaling.
