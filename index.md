**Hydrology and Hydroclimatology — available Oct 2025**

I’m an MSc candidate at Politecnico di Torino focusing on **trend detection** and **climatic attribution** of river flows. I build Python/GIS workflows for annual, seasonal, and monthly metrics (mean/low/high), mapping spatial patterns relevant to water management, drought planning, and flood risk.

- **Interests:** hydro-climate extremes, hydrological modelling, calibration & uncertainty, downscaling, remote sensing of ET & soil moisture

## Research & Selected Project Experience

**MSc Thesis Researcher – Long-term Changes in River Flow Regimes: Trends, Drivers, and Attribution Across Northern Italy**, Politecnico di Torino, Italy (March 2025 – Ongoing).  
Analyzing long-term discharge data across Northern Italy using Python and GIS (Mann–Kendall trend test, Sen’s slope). Attributing these changes to climatic indices, supporting evidence-based planning.

**Graduate Researcher – Electrokinetic Stabilization and Treatment of Soils**, Bu Ali-Sina University, Iran (2017 – 2018).  

**Adaptation Strategy for Wheat & Barley in Northeastern Iran**, Politecnico di Torino, Italy (2023 – 2024).  
Assessed current and mid-century crop water requirements using FAO CROPWAT under CMIP-driven climate scenarios. Evaluated adaptation options such as deficit irrigation and modified sowing dates for sustainable agricultural water use.

**Hydro-Meteorological Assessment of the Sangone River & Adaptation Strategies**, Politecnico di Torino, Italy (2023 – 2024).  
Analyzed water-scarcity adaptation strategies for the Sangone River Basin, Italy. Evaluated hydrological measures to improve basin resilience under reduced water availability.

**Pollutant Transport in the Missouri River: Hydrologic & Dispersion Assessment**, Politecnico di Torino, Italy (2023).  
Conducted hydrological assessment of pollutant transport at the Missouri–Platte River confluence. Evaluated water quality against EPA thresholds near Omaha and Nebraska City.

**Historical & Future Climate Change in Southeast Asia (Julia/Python + CMIP6)**, Politecnico di Torino, Italy (2023).  
Analyzed Southeast Asian climate trends (1950–2100) using EC-Earth and ACCESS models under RCP 4.5 and 8.5.

**Design of Open- and Closed-Loop Geothermal Systems (MODFLOW)**, Politecnico di Torino, Italy (2024).  
Simulated subsurface flow using MODFLOW 6 for an open-loop geothermal system; assessed aquifer behavior and thermal sustainability. Designed and evaluated a closed-loop vertical borehole heat exchanger array.

**Remote Sensing Study of Bandar-e Anzali, Northern Iran**, Politecnico di Torino, Italy (2023).  
Analyzed Landsat 8 imagery to assess land cover, vegetation health, and coastal features using spectral indices and classification methods; developed EO-based environmental analysis skills.
