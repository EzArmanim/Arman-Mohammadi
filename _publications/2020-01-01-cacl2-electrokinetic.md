In this journal article, Ouhadi, V.R., **Mohammadi, A.**, and Bahadorinezhad, O.R. (2020) investigate the effects of calcium‑chloride solution on the electrolysis and electro‑osmosis mechanisms of clayey soils during electrokinetic treatment processes. The study shows that CaCl₂ enhancement can improve electro‑osmotic flow and reduce electrolysis side effects, thus providing insights for soil remediation.
