**Hydrology and Hydroclimatology — available Oct 2025**

I’m an MSc candidate at Politecnico di Torino focusing on **trend detection** and **climatic attribution** of river flows. I build Python/GIS workflows for annual, seasonal, and monthly metrics (mean/low/high), mapping spatial patterns relevant to water management, drought planning, and flood risk.

- **Interests:** hydro-climate extremes, hydrological modelling, calibration & uncertainty, downscaling, remote sensing of ET & soil moisture
